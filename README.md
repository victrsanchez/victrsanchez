# 🧠 Víctor Sánchez Hernández — Backend Developer

## 🚀 About Me

I'm Víctor Sánchez Hernández, a backend developer passionate about building scalable, automated, and intelligent systems for high-compliance industries like fintech and legal tech. I specialize in clean architecture, microservices, and cloud-native solutions that solve real-world problems with precision and impact.

With over 4 years of experience, I've led projects that significantly reduced operational time in digital signature workflows and asset valuation processes. I thrive on transforming complexity into modular, maintainable code and integrating AI to enhance backend intelligence.

I'm also an open-source contributor and recently collaborated on a POS system for entrepreneurs. I'm currently exploring technical content creation to share my knowledge with the developer community. Open to opportunities across sectors that value innovation, automation, and backend excellence.
